515-B Drazil and His Happy Friends

You may notice that Drazil invites his friends periodically, and the period of invitation patterns is at most n * m (because there are only n * m possible pairs of boys and girls).

So if no one changes from unhappy to happy in consecutive n * m days, there won't be any changes anymore since then.

We can simulate the process of having dinner until there are no status changes in consecutive n * m days.

Because there are only n+m people, it's easy to prove the simulation requires O((n + m) * n * m) days.

But in fact, the simulation takes only O( n * m) days.(More accurately, the bound is (min(n, m) + 1) * (max(n, m) - 1) )

What happens? You can do some experiments by yourself. =) (you can suppose that only one person is happy in the beginning.)

In fact, this problem can be solved in O(n + m).

Let g be the greatest common divisor of n and m. If the i-th person is happy, then all people with number x satisfying will become happy some day because of this person.

So for each 0 ≤ i ≤ g - 1, we only need to check if there exists at least one person whose number mod g is i and is happy.
If it exists for all i, the answer is 'Yes', otherwise the answer is 'No'.
